Reports as 75 Minutes, but I think it was actually 74. Writing a long track can and will fail if it doesn't fit. Bad when it's over 70 minutes. 

I think I could have done a bit more work to try to break it up into multiple tracks, but my ears for DJ editing can't find the exact split point.

Needs a fuller battery for longer writes too. Will have to eventually experiment with shorter writes but definitely a selling point for buying a powered NetMD device if I'm going to continue down this rabbit hole.

LP2 seems mostly fine, especially on this older track. A bit of static in the quieter seconds, but I remember playing this song off a burned CD and the basic Gateway speakers that came with the computers. It's fine. Plus side means I fit the entire album onto one MD disc. (I did trim the last few songs)

All and all, good learnings, and pretty easy if you have well documented songs. Surprised it works as well as it did, given a bit of rust on the disc itself. Might also consider rechargable batteries.
