# cache
A TIL repo to unclutter my mind.

"The operating system keeps a __page cache__ in otherwise unused portions of the main memory (RAM), resulting in quicker access to the contents of cached pages and overall performance improvements."

I tend to forget how to install things on multiple workstations, or Google to see the latest tutorial site to cover WITH in SQL. This will hopefully keep it in one place for myself and maybe help others with this glorified cheatsheet.

Feel free to fork, add additions, or correct my spelling.

I may see if I can get some of these into [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/), or develop a similar offline app. Then again, this doesn't have to be for just code! 

TODO: Incorporate [TIL-RB](https://github.com/pjambet/til-rb/) to help generate it.
